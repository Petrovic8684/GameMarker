## 🔐 Backend

The backend of GameMarker is powered by **NestJS** with **TypeScript**, providing a robust RESTful API connected to a **PostgreSQL** database through **Prisma ORM**. Authentication is handled with JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to protected routes. External game data is fetched in real-time from the RAWG API.

It ensures secure, fast, and reliable interactions for the frontend, enabling real-time review creation, user management, and integration with external game databases. With NestJS and Prisma, the application is maintainable, scalable, and ready for future features.
